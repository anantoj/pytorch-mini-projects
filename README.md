# PyTorch Mini Projects
> A collection of small-scale projects that helped me learn the basics of the PyTorch framework

## Project #1: Simple Neural Network on Fashion MNIST dataset
What I learned:
* Linear Layers
* Activation functions
* Optimizers
* The low-level logic of Network hidden layers
* Creating a model class
* Handling the GPU
* Neural Network training pipeline
* Neural Network performance evaluation


## Project #2: Residual Neural Networks on CIFAR10 dataset
What I learned:
* Convolutional blocks
* Logic of ResNets
* Adam Optimizer
* One cycle policy learning rate scheduler
* Tuning ResNets

## Project 3: DCGANs on MNIST dataset
What I learned:
* Objectives of Discriminators and Generators
* Deconvolutional blocks
* Using latent tensors or noise to generate fake outputs
* Loss function of the Generator
* Training pipeline of DCGANs
* Tuning DCGANs
